# aMAZEing Visualiser

## Overview

The **aMAZEing Visualiser** is an interactable tool that allows anyone to create their
own maze and then observe a pathfinding alogirthm search for the shortest path
through the maze in real time. This is an excellent tool to help explain, demo, or
simply play around with some classic pathfinding algorithms. As a developper with 
an interest in algorithms, I find this to be both an educational project and a
fun experience.

Some of the key features of this application are:
- Implementation of famous pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkastra's and A*
- Ability to customize a maze and add obstacles, "weigths", and "portals" (more on those later)
- Customizeable speed and other visualisation settings

NOTE: Some of the things mentioned above are still under development and may therefore not be
present in the current version of the application.
